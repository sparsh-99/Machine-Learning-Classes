- ## Part-1 -> Data-preprocessing
Learn how to preprocess the data before jumping into the world of Machine Learning.

- ## Part-2 -> Regressions
  - ### Simple Linear Regression
     - Using 'Ordinary Least Squares Method', find the best fitting line and then predict the model using Training and Test Sets.
     - Some results of given dataset.

     - Scattering red dots are Observation values (gievn in the dataset) and the Blue one is the Regression Line (What should be the expected one, calculated using SLR).
